<h1>A Female President? Â¡SÃ­, Se Puede! ðŸ’ƒ</h1>
<p>Mexico is turning heads with the possibility of electing its first-ever female president. It's a momentous occasion that's lighting up the political landscape and sending waves of optimism across the nation. Whatâ€™s more? Mexico City's legislature has voted to decriminalize abortion, setting the stage for a more inclusive and progressive society. It's a landmark moment that not only respects women's rights but also challenges societal norms and taboos.</p>
<h1>A Historic Moment</h1>
<p>The idea of a female president in Mexico is no longer a far-off dream but a tantalizing reality. 
    The former Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum will face off against XÃ³chitl GÃ¡lvez, who is leading the opposition coalition. 
    </p>
<p>Ms Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old trained scientist, is a close ally of leftist President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. Current polling shows Ms Sheinbaum as the front-runner, partly down to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador enjoying an approval rating of more than 60%. He is required by the constitution to leave office after a single six-year term. But Ms GÃ¡lvez, an outspoken female senator with indigenous roots, will be competing for the presidential role.
</p>
<p>XÃ³chitl GÃ¡lvez is known for wearing indigenous clothing, using colloquial language and is often seen cycling around Mexico City. Her quick wit and down-to-earth demeanour makes her popular amongst  many working-class and young Mexicans.</p>
<p>She has repeatedly clashed with the president over issues including the high levels of violence in Mexico, stating that "ovaries are needed" to confront organised crime. He has accused her of being the candidate of the rich, the "oligarchs" and "conservatives".
</p>
<p>While the election is still on the horizon, the mere possibility is a cause for celebration. Having a female president isn't just symbolic; it's about representation. It's about women seeing themselves in leadership roles and realizing that their voices matter.</p>
<h1>The Power of Choice</h1>
<p>Mexico's supreme court has decriminalised abortion nationwide. An empowering step in contrast with the situation in the United States, where a Supreme Court ruling last year overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the right to abortion nationwide.
</p>
<p>The judgement comes two years after the court ruled in favour of a challenge to the existing law in the northern state of Coahuila. It had ruled that criminal penalties for terminating pregnancies were unconstitutional. The new ruling legalises abortion across all 32 states.
</p>
<p>The supreme court said the denial of the possibility of a termination violated the human rights of women.</p>
<p>"In cases of rape, no girl can be forced to become a mother - neither by the state nor by her parents nor her guardians," said the head of the supreme court, Arturo ZaldÃ­var.
    "Here, the violation of her rights is more serious, not only because of her status as a victim, but also because of her age, which makes it necessary to analyse the issue from the perspective of the best interests of minors."</p>
<p>
    The judgement opens the door for the federal healthcare system to provide abortions. It has been welcomed by women's rights groups. Mexico City was the first of the country's states to decriminalise abortion in 2007 and a dozen others followed suit.</p>
<p>While the new ruling is likely to anger Mexico's more conservative politicians and the Catholic Church, in what is Latin America's second largest Catholic nation, the Church's influence has been declining in recent years and the country's government considers itself staunchly secular.</p>
<p>Latin America has seen a trend towards loosening abortion restrictions that has been referred to as a "green wave". Elective abortion is legal in Colombia, Cuba, Uruguay and Argentina. This ruling signifies a significant shift in societal norms, a leap towards greater personal autonomy, and an acknowledgement of a woman's right to choose.</p>
